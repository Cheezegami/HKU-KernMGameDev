# Idea
The idea is to make a bomberman game using rocket launchers instead of dropping bombs. The most important feature is to get working characters in the level which are able to walk and shoot rockets. These rockets are able to hit other characters as well as bricks. Bricks may drop pick-ups upon exploding and will give the player more exposure to the terrain once destroyed. Players start locked in my bricks and will after destroying a few bricks be able to shoot rockets at other players.

Pickups will increase the following stats of the player :
- Rocket Blast Radius +-
- Rocket Velocity +-
- Rocket Cooldown +-
- Rocket Modifiers? Perhaps modifiers such as Triple Shot(Shoot 3 rockets at once with a delayed cooldown), Napalm Rockets (Inflict Burning Area after detonation) or Sticky Rockets (Stick to hit surface for a while before exploding) could be a thing.
- Player Speed +-
- Player Lives +
